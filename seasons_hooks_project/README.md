# Seasons Hooks Project
This project is a refactor from the Seasons Project but uses hooks for implementing life cycle methods and states instead implementing it with class based components.

The hook method is reusable and can be ported to other projects independently.

# Components

- SeasonDisplay: Component that tells weather conditions with respect to the month and latitude. (summer/winter)
- Spinner: Customisable loading spinner.
